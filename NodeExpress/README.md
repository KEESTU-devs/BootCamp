## NodeExpress.js

Welcome to the world of web development!

For this lesson, I want you to make some changes to an existing project

### Getting Started

**#### Let Keenan know before starting this project**

Firstly, since this is an application that is deployed on the web we do not want to make changes to MASTER with out Keenan's permission

So we will create a branch called marks_branch or brents_branch

```$xslt
$ cd Projects/CaylaCakes
$ git checkout -b "yourname_branch"
```

Now we need to install our dependencies

```$xslt
$ npm install
``` 

and now lets run the local server

```$xslt
$ npm start
```

Open Chrome and type in this url http://localhost:3000

BOOM, you should see the app.

Now open the project in Sublime. I want you to play around. See if you can change some of the text in the view files. 
Try opening the public/stylesheets/homepage.css and see if you can change some colors of the backgrounds

Just see what you can destroy, and what you can change

Once you have spent some time playing around in here, contact Keenan, we will be doing a web screen session to see what you found
and he will assign you some tasks to try out.

This is a real application, with the possibility to earn real money. So do not be overwhelmed by the code. Theres a lot here,
but you dont need to know all of it for now. Lets just focus on views.
